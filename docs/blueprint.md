## Core Features:

- AI Task Categorization: Utilize AI to categorize tasks into predefined categories based on their type and description.
- AI Task Classification: Employ AI to classify tasks into 'deep', 'light', and 'admin' work categories, including reasoning to incorporate details or not, as a tool.
- AI Duration Estimation: Use AI to estimate the duration of tasks, categorizing them into 15-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour blocks.
- AI Task Decomposition: Implement an AI-powered tool to decompose tasks exceeding 1 hour into smaller sub-tasks, each fitting within the 15-minute, 30-minute, or 1-hour duration blocks.
- Personalized Task Predictions: Analyze the user's historical task categorizations to personalize predictions for task type (deep, light, admin) and duration.
- Calendar Integration: Integrate with the user's Google Calendar data to enhance task categorization, grouping, and duration estimation.
- AI-Powered Task Scheduling: Schedule tasks based on research-backed energy cycles, prioritizing deep work followed by breaks and lighter tasks. Similar tasks are grouped to minimize cognitive switching.
- User Categorization Override: Allow users to modify the AI's task categorizations and remember these changes to improve future predictions based on user preferences.
- Task Grouping Display: Visually represent tasks grouped by category, type, and duration.
- Intuitive Task Input: Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting tasks and viewing the AI-driven categorizations and groupings.
